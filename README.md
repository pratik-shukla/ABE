The aim is to extend the bandwidth of audio signals using a simple Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. The algorithm takes a 4kHz signal and predicts the missing frequency components up to 8kHz.The approach uses two common speech features: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) values and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in different DNN configurations to achieve the desired expansion in bandwidth. To emphasize the spectral structure of the speech signals, cosine similarity is used as the loss function in the neural networks. The proposed approach predicts the missing high-frequency components frame by frame, and the final time domain signal is reconstructed using the GriffinLim algorithm. These reconstructed high pass (8 kHz) audio signals are perceptually better than the original 4 khz bandwidth signals. 

The model achieves a training accuracy of 99.06% and a test accuracy of 98.19%. STOI score is used to evaluate the reconstructed audio signal quality, and on a scale of 0-1, the reconstructed audio signal scores an average of 0.92.
